Blackjack Game
This repository contains a command-line implementation of the popular casino card game, Blackjack. The game is written in Python and follows standard casino rules. The player is dealt two cards, and their goal is to reach a score of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it. The game also includes a dealer, who follows specific rules for playing their hand.

Rules
The rules of Blackjack are as follows:

Each player is dealt two cards, face up. The dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Face cards (jack, queen, king) are worth 10 points, and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's choice.
The player can choose to "hit," meaning they want another card, or "stand," meaning they are happy with their current hand.
If the player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.
Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their total is 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If not, the hands are compared, and the player with the higher total wins. If the totals are equal, the game is a tie.
How to Play
To play the game, simply run the blackjack.py file in a command-line interface. The player is prompted to enter their name and can then play multiple rounds of Blackjack against the dealer.

Dependencies
This game requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or modules are required.

Future Improvements
Potential improvements for future versions of this game include adding the ability for the player to split their hand if they are dealt two cards of the same rank and adding a betting system. Additionally, a graphical user interface could be added to make the game more visually appealing.
